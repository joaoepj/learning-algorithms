Some notes about the course [MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Spring 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY)


## 1. Algorithms and Computation

### Goals:
1. Solve computational problems
2. Prove correctness
3. Argue efficiency
4. Communicate solution

### What is a problem?

A binary relation. A set of inputs and outputs. A predicate/statement that allow us to confirm that some relation between input and output holds.

### What is an algorithm?

A function description, a procedure, a recipe that explains how to obtain output from input, how input relates to output.

### The Birthday Match Problem

In a classroom, there are any pair of students with same birth date?

#### Proposed Algorithm:
- Add a student's birthday to a record
- Inform if a birthday pair exist in the record
- Repeat until there are no more students to add

#### Algorithm's properties:
- Correctness

Inductive Hypothesis:

if the first $k$ students contain a math
  
  the algorithm returns it before interviewing student $k+1$

Base case: $k = 0$

- Efficiency

Don't measure time, cause it depends on the power of computer. Instead, measure quantity of operations

Asymptotic (relative to problem input size) notation
- $O()$ upper bound
- $\Omega()$ lower bound
- $\Theta()$ both

$\Theta(1) \lt \Theta(\log{n}) \lt \Theta(n) \lt \Theta(n\log{n}) \lt \Theta(n^{2}) \lt \Theta(n^{c}) \lt 2^{\Theta(n^{c})}$

Note: $2^{\Theta(n^{c})}$, which I clearly do not understand

#### Code in go?

#### Explained Run time Analisys?

### Computation

Possible computing operations on the reference model of computation:

* Integer aritmethic
* logic operations
* bitwise operations
* Read and write from an arbitrary  memory address in constant time (Word-RAM)

A CPU takes a constant amount of time to operate on a constant amount of memory.

Operate over a linear amount of memory takes a linear amount of time.


Data structures are ways of storing non-constant amount and make operations over them faster.

#### Strategies to solve a problem.

1. Reduce it to a known algorithm
2. Design your own (recursive) algorithm

#### Asymptotics Exercises

3. Can't see how to reach answer with logarithmic operations
4. Why? Needs explanation (valid for all lacking mathematical background)

## 2. Data Structures and Dynamic Arrays

### Interface versus  Data Structure

#### Interface (API/ADT)
* Specification
* What data can stored
* Which operations are supported

#### Data Structure
* Representation
* How data is stored
* Algorithms supporting operations

### Interfaces

#### Sequence
* Characterized by an extrinsic (external) order, defined by who provided the data
* Operations: build, len, iterate, get_at, set_at

#### Set
* Characterized by an intrinsic (internal) order, usually a unique key.
* Operations: build, len, iterate, find

### Data Structures
* Static Array
* Linked List
* Dynamic Array

### Implementations

Notice that none of these implementations support insert_at, delete_at operations in sub-linear time.
 
#### Array Sequence

The memory of our computer is a big fixed-lenght array that allows implement get_at() and 
set_at() in $O(1)$ time because it can read and write any memory addres in constant time.

delete_at() and insert_at() implementation takes inear-time $O(n)$ as it requires moving data and resizing the array.

* Linked List Sequence
* Dynamic Array Sequence

## 3. Sets and Sorting

The Set interface can be simulated using a Sequence interface, but this results in poor performance

One of the simplest ways to get a faster Set is to store our items in a sorted array

Then we can simply binary search to find keys and support Order operations

This is still not great for dynamic operations (items still need to be shifted when inserting or removing from the middle
of the array), but finding items by their key is much faster!

### Sorting

#### Selection
#### Insertion
#### Merge

## 4. Hashing
## 5. Linear Sorting

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Goodbye Computer Science!")
}
```
